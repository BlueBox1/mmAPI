    <h3>Accelerated MultiMedia SDK</h3>
    <p></p>
    This MultiMedia API is an advanced video surveillance approach for combining core video hardware acceleration API's from multiple vendors into a single SDK. Transport mechanisms used for the parsing, muxing and network streaming are taken from open source projects including FFMPEG and Live555.<p></p>
    The interface utilizes all available system accelerated hardware architectures at runtime from the following vendors: Intel (MFX Interface) AMD (AMF Interface) NVIDIA (NVDEC\NVENC Interface).<p></p>
    The API will degrade to a CPU CODECS when acceleration methods are either exhausted or unsupported.<p></p>
    Using a combination of low level proprietary API's alongside Microsoft DirectX technology, the MultiMedia interface removes initial and ongoing complexities for video encode, decode, transcode and transport.<p></p>
    Hardware memory allocation and bandwidth negotiation provide high performance gains over traditional methods.<p></p>
    RTSP streaming via Live555 is used in favour of FFMPEG, see programmers guide for full details. Using Live555 for RTSP allows users to specify UTC Absolute Play time in accordance with RTSP RFC 2326 section 3.7 and ONVIF Streaming Specification for RTSP Audio and Video Synchronization section 5.2.1.1.2.<p></p>
    FFMPEG is used for transport and muxing by default for all other protocols.
